                        Problem 5

2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?


**/

//under construction

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int getSmallestNumber();

int main(){



  return 0;
}

//function to get the smallest divisible number
//postcondition : The number is returned
int getSmallestNumber(int max){

  int num = 1;

  for(int i = 1; i < max; i++){
    
    if(num % i == 0){//cehcks if the number is evenly divisible
      
    }
  }
}
